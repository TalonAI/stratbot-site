              Most service business owners don’t need another app—they need a way to think clearly when everything feels urgent. The best operators don’t rely on willpower or heroic effort. They use systems. Here's how to build your own—no tech jargon required.
            </p>

            <div className="mb-8">
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-r from-mosaics-dark to-mosaics-purple">1. Start With Your Defaults, Not Your Goals</h2>
              <p>
                You don’t need a new vision board. You need a default week that reflects reality. Strategic clarity begins with how you actually spend your time—then you decide what needs to change.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before you optimize, observe. Track where your time goes, spot the drift, and draw your ideal week around it. Start here before you hire, automate, or delegate.
              </p>
            </div>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-r from-mosaics-dark to-mosaics-purple">2. Turn Chaos Into Clarity With a Weekly Brief</h2>
              <p>
                Most founders drown in noise. A simple 15-minute clarity brief every Monday can reduce 80% of that. Focus on three things: what matters this week, what’s unresolved, and what needs your judgment.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is your personal decision cockpit. Done right, it replaces dozens of Slack threads and foggy priorities with a sharp execution lens.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-r from-mosaics-dark to-mosaics-purple">3. Delegate Thinking, Not Just Tasks</h2>
              <p>
                The real bottleneck isn’t labor—it’s leadership judgment. When you’re the only one who can make decisions, everything backs up behind you.
              </p>
              <p>
                Use a decision filter: what should people bring back to you, and what should they own? Make delegation a thinking system, not a to-do list.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-r from-mosaics-dark to-mosaics-purple">4. Track Decisions, Not Just Metrics</h2>
              <p>
                Every founder tracks KPIs. Few track how they made the decisions that got them there. That’s a missed opportunity.
              </p>
              <p>
                A simple decision journal—context, choices, outcome—lets you learn from your own patterns and sharpen future calls. It’s how you build intuition on purpose.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-r from-mosaics-dark to-mosaics-purple">5. Run a Thinking System, Not a Fire Drill</h2>
              <p>
                When your thinking system is working, things get quieter. You stop solving the same problem twice. Your calendar reflects your priorities. The team moves without checking in constantly.
              </p>
              <p>
                From the outside, it looks boring. Internally, it feels like traction. That’s the difference between a business with strategic rhythm—and one constantly reacting to noise.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-r from-mosaics-dark to-mosaics-purple">Final Thought</h2>
              <p>
                This isn’t about software. It’s about how you think—on purpose, with structure, every week. You don’t need another tool. You need a system that thinks like you when things get messy.
