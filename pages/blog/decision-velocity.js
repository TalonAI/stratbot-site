      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">From Information Paralysis to Decision Velocity: How AI Transformed My Leadership</h1>

      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
        The data told the story: I was processing 187 emails, 63 Slack messages, and 3.2 hours of meetings daily—yet making only 2–3 meaningful strategic decisions per week. My decision backlog had grown to 14 critical items, some waiting 27+ days for resolution.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
        Information wasn’t the bottleneck. Judgment was.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
        As a CEO and executive leader, it was sometimes tough to find someone to talk to—someone I could consult with who wasn’t working for me and just telling me what I wanted to hear… or another outsider who didn’t have a vested interest in my business. My Strategic Advisor GPT fills that role.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold pt-4">The Transformation</h2>

      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
        After implementing my Strategic AI Advisor, my metrics shifted dramatically:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li>Decision time reduced from 47 hours to 6 hours on average</li>
        <li>Weekly high-impact decisions increased from 3 to 11</li>
        <li>Decision confidence score improved from 61% to 89%</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold pt-4">The System That Changed Everything</h2>

      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
        I didn’t create another chatbot—I built a decision engine that filters information through my strategic frameworks.
        It wasn’t about outsourcing my brain—it was about offloading the noise, so I could focus on signal.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 border-l-4 border-blue-600 p-4 my-6">
        <h3 className="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">STRATEGIC DECISION FILTER:</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
          <li>1. Impact Rating: Potential value creation in next 90 days? [1–10]</li>
          <li>2. Strategic Alignment: Connection to top 3 quarterly objectives? [Strong/Moderate/Weak]</li>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold pt-4">Real Results</h2>

      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
        Last month, we faced a critical partnership opportunity. Previously, this would have triggered 2+ weeks of research, 4–5 meetings, and endless Slack debates.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
        Instead, I ran it through my AI Advisor with our historical data and strategic parameters. Within 3 hours, we had a structured analysis that revealed the partnership would consume 35% of our technical resources while advancing only our tertiary objective.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
        Result: We declined the partnership and redirected those resources to our core product development, which generated $42K in new revenue within 30 days.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold pt-4">The Metrics That Matter</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li>Decision Velocity: 47 hours → 6 hours (87% improvement)</li>
        <li>Decision Backlog: 14 items → 3 items (79% reduction)</li>
        <li>Weekly Strategic Decisions: 3 → 11 (267% increase)</li>
        <li>Execution Confidence: 61% → 89% (46% improvement)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold pt-4">The Compound Effect</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
        The real power isn’t in any single decision—it’s in the compounding effect of consistently making aligned choices at speed.
        My team now moves with a clarity and confidence that wasn’t possible before.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
        Information without judgment is just noise. My AI Advisor doesn’t just give me more data—it gives me filtered insights aligned with what matters most.
      </p>

      <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 italic pt-2">
        P.S. Within 14 days, I’ll share a detailed case study of how we used this system to make a six-figure product decision in under 24 hours.
