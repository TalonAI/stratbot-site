      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">From Strategic Drift to Consistent Revenue: How I Closed the Execution Gap</h1>

      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
        I was hemorrhaging $4,200 monthly on misaligned initiatives while my calendar showed the brutal truth: 72% reactive work, leaving just 5.5 hours weekly for true revenue-generating activities.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
        Strategy existed in documents. Execution happened elsewhere.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold pt-4">The Transformation</h2>

      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
        After implementing my Strategic Advisor system, I've identified two new revenue streams worth $12K/month and eliminated 9 hours of low-leverage work weekly. My strategic-to-tactical alignment score (something I now measure) jumped from 31% to 78%.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold pt-4">The System That Changed Everything</h2>

      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
        I didn’t just create another productivity tool—I built a decision framework that forces strategic alignment into every daily choice.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
        Here's the actual daily decision matrix I use:

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
          <li>1. Does this activity directly support my primary revenue goal? [Y/N]</li>
          <li>2. Will this leverage my core expertise and differentiation? [Y/N]</li>
          <li>3. Is this the highest-impact use of my next 90-minute focus block? [Y/N]</li>
          <li>4. If I complete only this today, will I still move forward? [Y/N]</li>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold pt-4">Real Results</h2>

      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
        Last month, my system flagged that I was spending 6.5 hours weekly on client processes that could be templated. By creating a standardized framework, I redirected that time to developing new service offerings.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
        Result: Two new clients at $6K/month each within 3 weeks.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold pt-4">The Metrics That Matter</h2>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li>Strategic Alignment Score: 31% → 78%</li>
        <li>Weekly High-Leverage Hours: 5.5 → 14.3</li>
        <li>Monthly Revenue from New Streams: $0 → $15,000</li>
        <li>Decision Velocity: 72 hours → 24 hours</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold pt-4">The Compound Effect</h2>

      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
        Every interaction with my system reinforces the neural pathways between strategic intent and daily execution. The gap between what I plan and what I do shrinks weekly.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
        Strategy isn't an annual retreat. It's a daily practice.
